<p id = "parastyle"> Owls possess large, forward-facing eyes and ear-holes, a hawk-like beak, a flat face, 
  and usually a conspicuous circle of feathers, a facial disc, around each eye.
 Owls can rotate their heads and necks as much as 270Â°. Owls have 14 neck vertebrae 
  compared to seven in humans, which makes their necks more flexible. </p>
